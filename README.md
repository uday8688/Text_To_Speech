# Text_To_Speech

High performance Deep Learning models for Text2Speech tasks.
Text2Spec models (Tacotron, Tacotron2, Glow-TTS, SpeedySpeech).
Speaker Encoder to compute speaker embeddings efficiently.
Vocoder models (MelGAN, Multiband-MelGAN, GAN-TTS, ParallelWaveGAN, WaveGrad, WaveRNN)
Fast and efficient model training.
Detailed training logs on console and Tensorboard.
Support for multi-speaker TTS.
Ability to convert PyTorch models to Tensorflow 2.0 and TFLite for inference.
Released models in PyTorch, Tensorflow and TFLite.
Tools to curate Text2Speech datasets underdataset_analysis.
Demo server for model testing.
Notebooks for extensive model benchmarking.
Modular (but not too much) code base enabling easy testing for new ideas.
